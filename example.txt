Welcome to the Simple RAG System Demo!

This is an example document that you can use to test the RAG system. The system is designed to help you understand how Retrieval-Augmented Generation works.

Key Features:
1. Document Processing: The system can handle PDF and TXT files
2. Web Content: You can add URLs to scrape and index content
3. Vector Storage: Documents are stored in a Qdrant vector database
4. Language Model: Uses Llama 2 for generating responses
5. User Interface: Simple Streamlit interface for interaction

To get started:
1. Upload this file or other documents
2. Add some URLs if you want to include web content
3. Ask questions about the content
4. The system will retrieve relevant information and generate answers

The system works by:
1. Breaking documents into chunks
2. Creating embeddings for each chunk
3. Storing embeddings in the vector database
4. Retrieving relevant chunks when you ask a question
5. Using the language model to generate answers based on the retrieved content

Try asking questions like:
- What are the key features of this system?
- How does the RAG system work?
- What types of documents can I upload?
